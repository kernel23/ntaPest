### ✅ Available Offline

Once the application has been loaded at least once with an internet connection, the following features will work offline:

*   **Opening the App:** You can launch the app from its icon on your home screen without a connection.
*   **Viewing Cached Data:** Any data you have previously viewed while online (like your list of farms, or details of a specific report) will be available to view offline.
*   **Creating a New Farm Plot:** You can create a new farm by saving its basic details (name, variety, planting date). The button to add the map location can be used later when you are back online.
*   **Creating a New Scouting Report:** You can fill out and save a new scouting report for any of your existing farms. This includes adding symptoms, severity, and attaching photos from your device's camera or gallery.
*   **Viewing Pest/Disease Information:** The information library for pests and diseases is cached and available to browse offline.

All data created offline is saved securely on your device and will be automatically synced to the server the next time you open the app with an active internet connection.
