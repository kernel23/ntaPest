# How to Install Agri-Guard on Your Android Phone

The Agri-Guard application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it directly onto your phone from the browser. It will look and feel just like a native app, with its own icon on your home screen, and it will work even when you are offline.

Follow these steps to install the app on your Android device using Google Chrome.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Open Google Chrome:**
    *   Find and tap the Google Chrome icon on your phone.

2.  **Go to the Agri-Guard Website:**
    *   In the address bar at the top of Chrome, type the URL for the Agri-Guard application and press Enter.
    *   *(Note: You will need to replace `your-website-url.com` with the actual address where the app is hosted.)*

3.  **Open the Chrome Menu:**
    *   Tap on the three-dot menu icon, which is usually in the top-right corner of the screen.

4.  **Select "Install app":**
    *   A menu will drop down. Look for the option that says **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"** and tap on it. Chrome will automatically detect that the site is an installable PWA.

5.  **Confirm the Installation:**
    *   A pop-up will appear with the Agri-Guard app icon and name. Tap the **"Install"** button to confirm.

6.  **Find the App on Your Home Screen:**
    *   The app is now installed! You can find the Agri-Guard icon on your phone's home screen or in your app drawer, just like any other application you've downloaded from the Play Store.

You can now launch Agri-Guard directly from its icon. The app will open in its own full-screen window, and you can use it to create new reports and add farm lots even if you don't have an internet connection.
